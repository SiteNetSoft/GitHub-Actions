Makers
======

Makers are GitHub Actions types for any kind of transformation or compiling.

.. note::

    Packagers are specificly for packaging the code of a project. Makers on the other hand are activities that would if not do require the usage of a Makefile.

It *never* deploys nor packages anything. It just does the transformation or building.
