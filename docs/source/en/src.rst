SRC == Source

The source directory contains all the source code for the project. The source code is organized into subdirectories based on the type of code.

For example, you have:

* `src/python` for Python code
* `src/bash` for Bash code

Etc.

.. note::

    The code found in the `src` are just simple scripts that are there to help with GitHub Actions nothing more.
